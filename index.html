      <p class="d11">Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in
      mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract
      infections that can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold
      (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), and others
      that can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other
      species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease,
      while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are yet to be vaccines
      or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.

      <p class="screen-only">
      Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family
      Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.They are
      enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and
      a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges
      from approximately 27 to 34 kilobases, the largest among known RNA viruses.
      The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona, meaning "crown" or
      "halo", which refers to the characteristic appearance reminiscent of a
      crown or a solar corona around the virions (virus particles) when viewed
      under two-dimensional transmission electron microscopy, due to the surface
      being covered in club-shaped protein spikes.</p>
